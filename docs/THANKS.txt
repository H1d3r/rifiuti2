Major credits should go to Keith Jones and all the folks at Foundstone
(which was acquired by McAfee in 2004). Without their analysis on
Windows Recycle Bin it would be much more difficult to fully dissect
the file format. Their elaborate white paper and original version of
rifiuti are available from ODESSA project:

There are more people to thank to:

Anthony Wong <ypwong@gmail.com> (manpage & original Debian packaging)
Hilda Chan (abnormal Vista recycle bin sample)

Finally, rifiuti2 won't have extensive testing without several OSS projects
and software archives:

1. winworldpc.com library, hosting many obsolete and unpurchaseable
   versions of Windows, especially ancient beta versions which provide
   insight on how Windows has evolved.

2. VirtualBox and Qemu, without their excellent virtual machine emulation
   it is simply impossible to test program behavior on different platforms.

3. A few website hosting obsolete service packs and ancient IE installers,
   relieving some pain on network access and tools installation in virtual
   machines:

   - Folks at browser.evolt.org who mirrored many ancient IE versions
   - Mirror for all NT service packs in sdfox7.com/winntsp.htm
